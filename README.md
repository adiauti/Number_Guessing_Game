# Number_Guessing_Game
A simple Python number guessing game that uses the random module. The program selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it. After each guess, the game provides hints ("too high" or "too low") until the correct number is found. It also displays the total number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
